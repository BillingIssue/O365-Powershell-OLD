# O365-Powershell-OLD
Old PS Scripts for O365

Ton of PS Scripts doing various things from times I was learning how to use code to automate my work. 
Ugly, sloppy, hardcoded but get work done. 

From time to time (or per request) I rework these diamonds into regular functions, dropping them into new repo.
